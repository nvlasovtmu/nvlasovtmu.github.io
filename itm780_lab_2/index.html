        <p> The program combines business management fundamentals with information systems and technology management. It also offers the opportunity to gain valuable professional experience through its co-op option. </p>
        <p> Notable Courses include ITM415: Business Process Management. This course proved especially useful as I relied on many of the core concepts it taught during my various co-op terms, particularly in my most recent placement. </p>
