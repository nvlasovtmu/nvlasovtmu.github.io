            <h2> SEO Techniques </h2>
            <p> <b> 1. Include Meta Description </b> – These HTML elements are used to describe the contents of a page. 
                Typically, they are placed in the header of a page and will be displayed in search engine results under the main title of the website. 
                This is useful for briefing users on what content is on the page before they even click on it, potentially drawing them in. 
                Similarly, meta descriptions can aid in search engine optimization as the search engine will use keywords from the description. 
                Effective descriptions should prioritize relevancy to the content on the page and stay concise – between 150-300 characters.

            <p> <b> 2. Optimize your Images</b> – This is a technique primarily to increase responsiveness of the website and therefore improve its ranking on search engines. 
                Speed and responsiveness are important to users as they want minimal latency and loading during their interactions with a website. 
                A responsive website is one that is likely to have repeat traffic, thus improving its ranking in search engines. 
                The technical component of this optimization involves compressing images to an appropriate size and including accessibility features such as alt tags.

            <p> <b> 3. Include a Title Tag </b> – Important tag to specify the title of the webpage. 
                This should be descriptive and unique as it will likely be the first thing users see in the search engine results. 
                Inclusion of a title tag is one of the most important features for SEO as it represents the primary identifier of a web page. 
                It appears in a number of places including web browser tabs, auto-formatted links, and of course search engine results. 
                Optimized title tags should utilize keywords, site or organizational branding and should be short in length.

            <p> <b> 1. Use a Cohesive Theme and Brand </b> – Inclusion of a well put together bio, URL, and page name will mean increased engagement with your social media page. 
                Often times the bio will serve as the meta description for your social media page, and as such it should be relevant, unique, and interesting to read – the same applies for the other elements. 
                Refining all of the major elements of your page will help to make the page more appealing and seem more important and authentic to users when it appears in their search results.

            <p> <b> 2. Encourage the Mashup </b> – This tip comes from Rohit Bhargava, and emphasizes the benefit of increased engagement through the additional of user input to existing content. 
                Users often want their voices to be heard, and providing them with an opportunity to leave a lasting impact on your content is sure to boost engagement and sharing across the board.

            <p> <b> 3. LinkedIn Optimization </b> - LinkedIn is an important platform for professional networking and can not only help one form useful connections, but also drive engagement on other sites and platforms. 
                In optimizing your LinkedIn page, you can aim to be more prevalent in search results on the website itself. 
                The increased traffic on your LinkedIn page is then likely to result click-through traffic to whatever content you link there. 
                Techniques for this include setting a unique title tag with your page name instead of the default randomly generated one. 
                LinkedIn is quite flexible in this regard and will allow you to put together an easy to remember link. 
                Including key details from your resume in your page description will also aid in increasing engine optimization on the platform as its keywords will be picked in search results.
